## Technology

Server side, Drywall is built with the [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
framework. We're using [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) as a data store.

The front-end is built with [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/).
We're using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for the asset pipeline.

| On The Server | On The Client  | Development |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| Express       | Bootstrap      | Grunt       |
| Jade          | Backbone.js    |             |
| Mongoose      | jQuery         |             |
| Passport      | Underscore.js  |             |
| Async         | Font-Awesome   |             |
| EmailJS       | Moment.js      |             |


## Live demo

| Platform                       | Username | Password |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| https://drywall.herokuapp.com/ | root     | h3r00t   |

__Note:__ The live demo has been modified so you cannot change the root user,
the root user's linked admin role or the root admin group. This was done in
order to keep the app ready to use at all times.


## Requirements

You need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) and
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) installed and running.

We use [`bcrypt`](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node.bcrypt.js) for hashing
secrets. If you have issues during installation related to `bcrypt` then [refer
to this wiki
page](https://github.com/jedireza/drywall/wiki/bcrypt-Installation-Trouble).


## Installation

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jedireza/drywall.git && cd ./drywall
$ npm install
```


## Setup

First you need to setup your config file.

```bash
$ mv ./config.example.js ./config.js #set mongodb and email credentials
```

Next, you need a few records in the database to start using the user system.

Run these commands on mongo via the terminal. __Obviously you should use your
email address.__

```js
use drywall; // or your mongo db name if different
```

```js
db.admingroups.insert({ _id: 'root', name: 'Root' });
db.admins.insert({ name: {first: 'Root', last: 'Admin', full: 'Root Admin'}, groups: ['root'] });
var rootAdmin = db.admins.findOne();
db.users.save({ username: 'root', isActive: 'yes', email: 'your@email.addy', roles: {admin: rootAdmin._id} });
var rootUser = db.users.findOne();
rootAdmin.user = { id: rootUser._id, name: rootUser.username };
db.admins.save(rootAdmin);
```


## Running the app

```bash
$ npm start

# > Drywall@0.0.0 start /Users/jedireza/projects/jedireza/drywall
# > grunt

# Running "copy:vendor" (copy) task
# ...

# Running "concurrent:dev" (concurrent) task
# Running "watch" task
# Running "nodemon:dev" (nodemon) task
# Waiting...
# [nodemon] v1.3.7
# [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
# [nodemon] watching: *.*
# [nodemon] starting `node app.js`
# Server is running on port 3000
```

Now just use the reset password feature to set a password.

 - Go to `http://localhost:3000/login/forgot/`
 - Submit your email address and wait a second.
 - Go check your email and get the reset link.
 - `http://localhost:3000/login/reset/:email/:token/`
 - Set a new password.

Login. Customize. Enjoy.

## Questions and contributing

Any issues or questions (no matter how basic), open an issue. Please take the
initiative to include basic debugging information like operating system
and relevant version details such as:

```bash
$ npm version

# { drywall: '0.0.0',
#   npm: '2.5.1',
#   http_parser: '2.3',
#   modules: '14',
#   node: '0.12.0',
#   openssl: '1.0.1l',
#   uv: '1.0.2',
#   v8: '3.28.73',
#   zlib: '1.2.8' }
```

Contributions are welcome. Your code should:

 - pass `$ grunt lint` without error

If you're changing something non-trivial, you may want to submit an issue
first.
